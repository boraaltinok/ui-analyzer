## Step-by-Step: Netlify Deployment

2. **Drag & Drop**:
   - Select this entire project folder
   - Drag it to the Netlify deploy area
3. **Get URL**: Netlify provides instant live URL
4. **Custom Domain** (optional): Add your own domain in settings

## Environment Variables

No environment variables needed! The app runs entirely client-side and prompts users for their own OpenAI API keys when needed.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

Both Vercel and Netlify support custom domains:
- Vercel: Project Settings â†’ Domains
- Netlify: Site Settings â†’ Domain Management

## Sharing with Coworkers

Once deployed, share:
1. **Live URL** - The deployed app link
2. **Instructions** - Tell them to get OpenAI API keys for real analysis
3. **Demo Mode** - They can skip API key for demo functionality

## Security Notes

- App runs client-side only
- API keys entered by users are never sent to your server
- No backend or database required
- Safe to share publicly

Your UI Analyzer will be live and shareable in under 5 minutes! ðŸŽ‰
